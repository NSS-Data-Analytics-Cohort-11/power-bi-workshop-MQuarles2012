I am interested in Redfin for sale data for my area. Redfin only allows 350 home data to be downloaded at one time, so I had to use some filters to narrow it down. I applied the following filters: 
1. Drew boundary on map to include only White House, Goodlettsville, Hendersonville, and Gallatin. (see screenshot)
2. Only looked at properties classified as "House" 
3. Only looked at Actively listed houses (no coming soon or under contract/pending properties)
4. Excluded 55+ communities, short sales, and listings with an HOA fee

This produced a list of 302 houses
It may be interesting to compare these to the market analysis here: https://www.redfin.com/city/12545/TN/Millersville/housing-market 


Comparing Rentals
1. Same boudaries as above
2. No filters because there are much less properties available for rent

Yields 145 listings
